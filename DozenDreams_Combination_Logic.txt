DozenDreams Player Selection & Team Combination Logic
=====================================================

üß† Core Logic:
--------------
- Total pool of players: 30
- Final team must have 11 players
- Player selection conditions based on Captain (C) and Vice-Captain (VC):

  Rules:
  - If both Captain & Vice-Captain are selected ‚ûù Max 9 players can be selected manually
  - If only one of Captain or Vice-Captain is selected ‚ûù Max 10 players
  - If neither is selected ‚ûù Max 11 players can be manually selected

üîÅ Team Generation:
-------------------
- After selecting players (N selected), fill (11 - N) from the remaining pool (30 - N)
- For each complete team:
   ‚Ä¢ If both C & VC selected by user ‚ûù keep them fixed
   ‚Ä¢ If only one (C or VC) selected ‚ûù generate combinations by fixing that and rotating the other
   ‚Ä¢ If neither selected ‚ûù generate all possible C/VC pairs (i ‚â† j)

üí° Notes:
---------
- Combinations are calculated as: C(N, K) = N! / [K!(N-K)!]
- C(remaining_pool, extra_needed) √ó permutations of captain/vice-captain
- System should limit to top 10,000 combinations based on credit and role validation

üìå Tip:
-------
For performance, restrict combinations at controller level with max limit.
